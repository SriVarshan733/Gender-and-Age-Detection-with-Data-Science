# Gender and Age Detection with Data Science
### ✅ Objective

Our objective is to develop a programme that can identify a person's gender and age . However, determining age might not be as easy as you believe. Age prediction may seem to be a regression issue, am I right? And you are correct in your assumption. When treating this as a regression issue, researchers encountered a number of unknowns, including camera quality, brightness, temperature, backdrop, etc.

### ✅ Project Context

We'll utilize pre-trained models for age prediction because our major focus is on how to create the age predictor using OpenCV with existing models.

### ✅ Description 

While training datasets for generic object recognition tasks can frequently include hundreds of thousands or even millions of photos, those containing age and/or gender labels are typically much smaller, numbering in the thousands or, at most, tens of thousands. The issue is that in order to tag these photographs, we must have access to the subjects' private information. We would specifically need to know their date of birth and gender, as this information is rarely made public. We would specifically need to know their date of birth and gender, as this information is rarely made public. As a result, we must accept the nature of the issue we are trying to solve and modify network designs and computational strategies accordingly.
